Welcome to Liberté Linux!
-------------------------

The "liberte" directory should be moved to the root
of the removable drive which you want to boot. Then,
launch setup.bat. This procedure needs to be done
only once, further upgrades can be extracted over the
existing file hierarchy on the drive.

Please reboot your computer in order to launch
Liberté.

In order to boot from a USB stick, enable booting
from USB Key in your computer BIOS, and give it
precedence over regular hard disk boot. Or, you can
enable the Multiboot menu in BIOS.
