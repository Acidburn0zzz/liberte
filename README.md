# Liberté Linux: Mission-critical stealth communication

[Liberté Linux](http://dee.su/liberte) is a [secure](http://dee.su/liberte-security), reliable, lightweight and [easy to use](http://dee.su/liberte-documentation) [Gentoo-based](http://www.gentoo.org/) LiveUSB/SD/CD Linux distribution with the primary purpose of enabling anyone to communicate safely and covertly in [hostile environments](http://dee.su/liberte-motivation). Whether you are a privacy advocate, a dissident, or a sleeper agent, you are equally likely to find Liberté Linux useful as a mission-critical communication aid.

See [build instructions](http://dee.su/liberte-build) if you want to master a custom Liberté Linux image. Liberté can also serve as a robust framework for mastering Gentoo-based LiveUSBs/CDs. The build process is fully automated with incremental build support, and is more mature and reliable than most of Gentoo's own outdated [LiveCD tools](http://wolf31o2.org/projects/). Gentoo is an extremely flexible distribution for safely generating custom live media from source — for instance, Liberté does not contain Portage, GCC, Perl or Python.
