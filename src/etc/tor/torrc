# Do not relay. From Tor FAQ:
#   Three different research papers describe ways to identify the relays in a
#   circuit by running traffic through candidate relays and looking for dips
#   in the traffic while the circuit is active. These clogging attacks are not
#   that scary in the Tor context so long as relays are never clients too. But
#   if we're trying to encourage more clients to turn on relay functionality
#   too (whether as bridge relays or as normal relays), then we need to
#   understand this threat better and learn how to mitigate it.
