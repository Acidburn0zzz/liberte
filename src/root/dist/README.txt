Welcome to Liberté Linux!
-------------------------

The "liberte" directory should be moved to the root
of the removable drive which you want to boot. Then,
launch setup.bat. This procedure needs to be done
only once, further upgrades can be extracted over the
existing file hierarchy on the drive.

Please reboot your computer in order to launch
Liberté.

In order to boot from a USB stick, enable booting
from USB drive in your computer BIOS, and give it
precedence over regular hard disk boot. Or, you can
enable the Multiboot menu in BIOS.

Another option is to install Liberté to USB or SD media,
but boot from a bootstrap CD, which then continues with
USB/SD. This also allows to ensure that the booted kernel
has not been corrupted by malware.

NOTE: The USB stick needs to be formatted as FAT/FAT32.
Older computers might be able to boot only FAT(16)-formatted
USB keys - the corresponding BIOS boot option is typically
"USB RMD-FDD".
