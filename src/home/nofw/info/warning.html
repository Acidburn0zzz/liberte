    <title>WARNING: Unsafe Browser</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Warning!</h1>

    <p>
      You are running an <strong>unsafe non-Torified browser</strong> under
      a specially designated user. It is intended to be used in cases where
      web setup is necessary in order to initiate an Internet connection
      (such as Wi-Fi hotspots registration).
    </p>

    <p>
      Connections are made in the clear, and are <strong>not</strong>
      Torified. Please quit this browser as soon as the Internet connection
      setup is finalized.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that since the browser is run under different user credentials,
      <em>uim</em>-based multilingual input methods will not work.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your settings will <strong>not</strong> be saved.
    </p>

    <p>
      Press <a href="http://www.google.com/">here</a> to go to an arbitrary
      location for Wi-Fi registration. It is possible that you will need
      to disconnect and reconnect after completing the registration.
