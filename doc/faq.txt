Q: Do I need Gentoo to build Libert√© Linux?
A: No, the build scripts are distribution-neutral.

Q: How long does is the full build process?
A: On the order of 5 hours on dual-core 2.66GHz Intel E8200.

Q: Can I use network proxies during the build?
A: Yes, the "enter" script passes the environment variables
   RSYNC_PROXY, http_proxy, and ftp_proxy through.

Q: Is it possible to run "./setup" more than once in same
   source directory?
A: Yes.

Q: Is it necessary to run the full build process every time one
   wants to build an updated CD/USB image?
A: No, it is OK to update the source tree manually (or run
   "./setup fast" and then follow the usual
   mkroot copy/mkroot clean/mkimage process).

Q: I would like to go over the emerge messages carefully.
A: See /var/log/emerge.log and /var/log/portage/elog/summary.log
