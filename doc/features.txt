Liberté Linux Features
----------------------

Liberté Linux is a secure, lightweight, and easy to use Gentoo-based Linux
distribution intended as a communication aid in hostile environments. You
can install it on a USB key (which can double as a regular USB storage in
any OS), and boot Liberté on any computer or laptop. Its internet connection
(if available) is then used to set up a Tor circuit, and you are assigned a
persistent global ID. Using this ID, you can stealthily communicate with
other Liberté users. The distribution includes all the necessary image and
document processing applications, and can also be used as a secure browsing
platform.

Boot
----

* Gentoo Hardened kernel 2.6.28-r9
      + UnionFS 2.5.4 + unlink patch
      + uvesafb framebuffer driver
      + fbcondecor framebuffer console decoration

* Genkernel's initramfs
      + Kernel-level UnionFS is used
      + Read-only root is compressed with SquashFS-LZMA

* Autodetection of hardware
      + Conservative CPU governor is used to save power
      + Hard disks are switched to quiet mode and are spun down
      + Power management is enabled on wireless devices
      + X is set up using Xorg -configure
      + hwsetup is not used at all
      + Some microcode is included

* FAT32 Windows-visible USB partition is used for persistent storage
  of user's config directory changes.
      + Histories and logs are either not created, or not saved

* A power-off watchdog is armed on an abrupt removal of USB boot device
      + Memory is zeroed-out upon normal shutdown

* No uncontrolled growth in the RAM part of UnionFS
      + All logs are limited in size
      + Memory requirements: ~128MB

* System is locked down during boot
      + Root password is disabled (main user doesn't have a password)
      + Processes drop privileges (tor, privoxy, ntp, messagebus, nscd)
      + Root console is available for 2 minutes after boot, for
        troubleshooting (e.g., run "passwd root", then audit logs)

* No user interaction is necessary during boot
      + Applications are pre-configured and ready to use
      + Main user is is automatically logged into X
      + All static and removable disks are available via udev+autofs


Network
-------

* Netfilter IP firewall protects the host, prevents DNS and other leaks
      + Default deny on incoming and outgoing external connections
      + Rate-limited ping reply is allowed
      + DHCP, NTP and Tor external communication is allowed
      + Only NTP and Tor are allowed to use DNS
      + Only Tor can connect to hidden service daemon [loopback]
      + Only main user and Privoxy can connect to Tor [loopback]
      + Only main user can connect to Privoxy         [loopback]
      + Additional IPv4 protection using kernel parameters

* Tor hidden service hostname persistence
      + Saved to user's config directory after first Tor execution
      + Restored upon each subsequent boot
      + Tor does not act as a relay

* Wicd manages internet connectivity
      + Wired connections are set up automatically
      + Wireless password is intuitively configured via X GUI
      + DHCP transmits are locked down (hostname, identification,
        ARP, IPv4LL are disabled)
      + MAC address is changed before each DHCP setup
      + NTP and Tor are automatically restarted after reconnect

* NTP connects to known server pool
      + [0-4].pool.ntp.org
      + DHCP may also provide an NTP server address
      + Hardware clock is assumed UTC, and not saved upon shutdown
      + First adjustment can be big, so non-UTC clock is fine


Applications
------------

* i686 architecture is assumed
      + PentiumPro or better
      + MMX support is not necessary
      + x86 (32-bit) binaries

* Fully modular X
      + Only TrueType fonts (for all languages supported by SCIM)
      + Custom ebuilds: Sinhala, Dhiveni

* LXDE- and GTK+-based desktop
      + No GNOME or KDE
      + lxpanel, openbox, pcmanfm, xarchiver, lxterminal, ...
      + Midnight Commander is available for console use

* Multilingualization (input languages) using SCIM
      + All languages that are supported by m17n-lib
      + Native support for CJK languages (pinyin, anthy, hangul)
      + An input pad and virtual keyboard are available as well

* Application-level (user interface) internationalization
      + All unicode locales are compiled in
      + Locale and timezone are easily changed using custom tool,
        and UI languages are changed on next login
